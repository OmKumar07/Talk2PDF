- [ ] Frontend loads without errors
- [ ] File upload works end-to-end
- [ ] Question answering functional
- [ ] All features working as expected

### 📊 Performance Benchmarks

- [ ] Page load time < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response time < 5 seconds
- [ ] File processing time reasonable
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Error rate < 1%

## Troubleshooting Reference

### 🚨 Common Issues

- **CORS Errors**: Check FRONTEND_URL in Render
- **API Connection Failed**: Verify VITE_API_URL in Netlify
- **Build Failures**: Check Node/Python versions
- **Upload Errors**: Verify file size limits
- **Memory Issues**: Monitor resource usage

### 🔧 Quick Fixes

- **503 Errors**: Check if Render service is sleeping
- **Build Timeouts**: Increase build timeout in Netlify
- **Slow Performance**: Upgrade Render instance type
- **SSL Issues**: Verify HTTPS configuration
